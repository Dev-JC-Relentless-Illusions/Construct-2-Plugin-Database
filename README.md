# Construct 2 Plugin Database
 A collection of every plugin i have found on the internet so far, most untested, none are made by me i just wanted to save everyone else the hassle of clicking on heaps of links.

So alot of these i havent got around to pulling the actual addon out of the sub folders so if you do any of that id be grateful if you committed it. So that being said the collection is not fully ready for use. But you can still download it and either install current pulled addons or also extract/pull the ones left in the folders yourself.

To install, go to your construct 2 directory and paste the exporters folder into it. Done!
