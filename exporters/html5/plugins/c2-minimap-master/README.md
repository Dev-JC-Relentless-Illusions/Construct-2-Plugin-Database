###Available variables are : 

- **minimap** : <u>required</u> if you want to show this object on the map
- **minimap_discover** : The object is not shown until *discovered* state is set to true (and *show* also set to true)
- **minimap_scale** : The object will be scale to this factor on the minimap
- More are coming

Do not hesitate to send me your ideas and how I could improve the plugin
